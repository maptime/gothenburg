title: Let's learn leaflet.js!

This session is all about [leaflet.js](http://www.leafletjs.com), a javascript library for making web maps! 

[Per Liedman](http://www.twitter.com/liedman) who is one of the developers on the leaflet.js core team will be talking about what leaflet is and how it can be used, demoing what can be done with it. The thought is to put the talk on a level where both leaflet beginners and experienced users will benefit!

After the talk you will be able to create your own leaflet map hands-on, so bring your computer equipped with your favorite text editor.

If you donâ€™t want to make your own map, just mingle and talk about maps! If you happen to know leaflet already, perfect, then you can guide the beginners!

Looking forward to see you all there!
