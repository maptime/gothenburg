Welcome to the first Maptime GBG meetup! 

Maptime is open for everybody, beginner to pro. This will be a time to share experience, have interesting discussions and learn from each other. 

This first meetup will be an introduction to web mapping and Open Street Map. (A more detailed schedule will be available soon)

The plan is also to discuss what future topics could be and what you expect of Maptime GBG in the future! (Computers are not required for this first meetup.)

See you there!
